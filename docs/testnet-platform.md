You can try the saving & lending platform at [tadpole.finance](https://tadpole.finance). Currently, the platform is still under development and is not ready for real money transactions. We need to make sure all codes are well tested and formally audited before we launch it on the mainnet. The Tadpole smart contracts were deployed in the Goerli testnet and can play around using testnet tokens.

## How to Test the Saving & Lending Platform?

1. Open your [Metamask](https://metamask.io) Application or Browser Extension.
2. Make sure you change the "Ethereum Mainnet" to "Goerli Test Network" in the Network Option.
